            <p> 
                Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. A player gives
                an initial state, which then evolves according to a set of rules:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A "live cell" (white) with fewer than two live neighbours "dies" (turns black), 
                    simulating underpopulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, simulating overpopulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours revives live cell, simulating reproduction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A live cell with exactly two or three live neighbours lives on.
                </li>
            </ol>
